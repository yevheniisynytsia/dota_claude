Your job: win lane, control tempo, make space for carry or be a second carry.

## Networth Benchmarks

| Minute | Target Networth | What You Should Have |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| 10 | 5,000 - 7,000 | Boots + core laning item (Bottle, Null Talis, etc.) |
| 15 | 8,500 - 11,000 | First core item (Blink, Orchid, Eul's, etc.) |
| 20 | 13,000 - 16,000 | First core + BKB or second item |
| 25 | 17,000 - 21,000 | Two-three core items |
| 30 | 22,000 - 27,000 | Full fighting build |

## Key Item Timings

| Item | Target Minute | Heroes |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Bottle | 0-2 min | Every mid hero (buy at start or first bounty rune) |
| Blink Dagger | 11-14 min | Puck, Queen of Pain, Magnus, Tiny |
| Orchid/Bloodthorn | 13-16 min | Storm Spirit, Queen of Pain, Void Spirit |
| Eul's Scepter | 11-14 min | Lina, Shadow Fiend, Invoker, Leshrac |
| BKB | 18-22 min | Most mid heroes for teamfight timing |
| Aghs Scepter | 18-22 min | Invoker, Lina, Zeus |
| Witch Blade | 8-10 min | Puck, Void Spirit, Hoodwink |

## Laning Phase (0-10 min)

### Rune Control
- **Water Runes** spawn at 2:00 and 4:00 in both river spots
- **Power Runes** spawn at 6:00 and every 2 minutes after, alternating river sides
- **Bounty Runes** spawn at 0:00 and every 3 minutes after
- Push the wave before rune spawn so you can contest without missing CS
- If you get a favorable rune (DD, Haste), consider an immediate gank on sidelanes

### Creep Aggro
- Right-click an enemy hero (even if out of range) to pull creeps toward you
- Use this to get last hits without committing forward
- Do this **outside** of 500 range of enemy creeps to redirect them without moving your creep wave

### Matchup Adjustments
- **Losing the lane?** Focus on CS, pull creeps, get runes. Don't force trades you'll lose. Stack your jungle camps for later.
- **Winning the lane?** Harass and deny, control runes, push wave and stack/farm jungle between waves
- **Even matchup?** Focus on CS advantage and rune control. One good rune can break the stalemate.

## Mid-Game Rotations (10-25 min)

### When to Gank
- You have Blink / mobility ult and a sidelane has a kill opportunity
- Your sidelane is getting dove — TP immediately
- You have a Haste, Invis, or DD rune
- Enemy mid is dead or gone — use the opening

### When to Stay Mid
- You're close to a key item timing (1-2 min away)
- Enemy mid is a stronger ganker — hold tower and farm
- Your sidelanes are winning without help

### Rotation Priorities
1. **TP to saves** — defending dives on your carry is usually the highest value rotation
2. **Gank the losing lane** — help your offlane / support get back into the game
3. **Smoke gank** with supports for a high-value kill (enemy carry)

## General Tips

- **Bottle management:** Never waste Bottle charges. Use them during trades or after taking harass. Always have 1+ charges before rune spawn.
- **Tower pressure:** After kills or ganks, push the tower. Mid T1 falling opens the map.
- **Map awareness:** Check minimap every 5-10 seconds. Call missing enemy mid immediately (Alt-click portrait or type "mid miss").
- **Stack camps:** When walking past jungle, stack camps for yourself or carry.
- **Buy wards mid:** A ward on high ground mid or the rune spot is often worth buying yourself.
- **Communicate:** Ping enemy items (BKB, Blink) so your team knows.
- **Buyback:** After 25 min, keep buyback gold if a fight could decide the game.

## Mid-Lane Ward Spots

### Radiant Mid
- **Radiant high ground ward** — covers both rune spots and mid approach
- **Behind Dire T1 mid** — spots ganks from enemy jungle
- **River ward** near power rune — contest rune safely

### Dire Mid
- **Dire high ground ward** — covers both rune spots and mid approach
- **Radiant triangle entrance** — spot enemy mid farming jungle
- **River ward** on Radiant side — see rotations early

## Common Mistakes
- Missing CS to harass (CS is almost always more valuable than trading 1 hit)
- Not stacking camps when passing through jungle
- Rotating to gank when you'll miss 2+ creep waves for an uncertain kill
- Ignoring rune timers — losing rune control snowballs against you
- Building greedy items when you need to fight early (Midas when team needs you now)
- Not carrying TP scroll for counter-ganks
