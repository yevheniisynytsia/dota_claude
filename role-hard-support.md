# Hard Support Guide (Pos 5)

Your job: protect your carry, control vision, create space, and enable teamfights.

## Networth Benchmarks (Realistic Support Economy)

| Minute | Target Networth | What You Should Have |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| 10 | 2,000 - 3,000 | Boots + Wind Lace/Magic Stick + wards/sentries |
| 15 | 3,500 - 5,000 | Upgraded boots + Wand + working toward first item |
| 20 | 5,000 - 7,500 | First core item (Glimmer/Force/Urn upgrade) |
| 25 | 7,000 - 10,000 | First core + components for second |
| 30 | 9,000 - 13,000 | Two core items |

> Support networth is lower — that's normal. Your value comes from spells, vision, and positioning, not items.

## Key Item Timings

| Item | Target Minute | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Boots | 3-5 min | Don't delay boots — you need movement speed to trade and rotate |
| Magic Wand | 5-8 min | Core vs. spell-spamming laners (Bristleback, Zeus, Skywrath) |
| Urn of Shadows | 10-14 min | Buy if no one else has. Great for ganking heroes. |
| Glimmer Cape | 16-20 min | Default save item vs. magic burst |
| Force Staff | 16-20 min | Default save item vs. Clockwerk, Riki, melee threats |
| Ghost Scepter | 14-18 min | Vs. heavy right-click (PA, Ursa, Troll) |
| Aeon Disk | 22-28 min | Late-game insurance vs. burst/initiation |

## Warding Guide

### Early Game Wards (0-10 min)
- **Pull camp ward** — protect your pull camp from being blocked
- **River ward** — spot mid rotations to safelane
- **Offlane cliff ward** — see enemy movements if you're rotating
- **Deward priority:** Check your pull camp and rune spots for enemy wards

### Mid-Game Wards (10-25 min)
- **Aggressive wards** — place near enemy jungle entrances when your team is pushing
- **Defensive wards** — cover your carry's farming area (triangle, jungle entries)
- **Roshan pit** — always have vision near Rosh after 15-20 min
- **Rotate ward spots** — don't place in the same location twice; enemies will deward

### Late-Game Wards (25+ min)
- **High ground wards** — before pushing enemy base
- **Defensive high ground** — if defending, ward your jungle entrances
- **Deep wards** — behind enemy T2/T3 if safe to place (smoke + ward)

### Dewarding Tips
- Carry 1-2 **Sentry Wards** at all times
- Check common ward spots after seeing enemy support near them
- Use Sentry + Observer combos: place sentry to deward, observer for new vision
- Deward gives 100 gold — it's efficient for support economy

## Smoke & Map Tips

### Smoke Timing
- First smoke at **5-7 min** with your mid or offlane for a gank
- Smoke after winning a fight to push objectives or Roshan
- Smoke when all lanes are pushed and you can't find the enemy
- Don't smoke with just 2 people late game — bring at least 3-4

### Rotation Paths
- Always **TP to counter-dives** on your carry — this is your highest priority
- Walk rotations from offlane to mid at night (less vision = better ganks)
- Use **Smoke of Deceit** when crossing river for a gank

## Pulling & Stacking

### Pull Timings (approximate — varies by camp)
- **Small camp pull:** :15 / :45 (hit camp at these clock times)
- **Medium camp pull-through:** Pull small camp, then aggro medium camp when small camp creeps are low
- **Stack timing:** :53-:55 for most camps (walk away from camp to draw creeps out)

### When to Pull
- Your lane is **pushing too far** (creep wave is past river)
- Your carry needs **solo XP** to hit a level spike
- You need **gold** from pulling and deny the enemy offlaner XP

### When NOT to Pull
- Your carry is getting **dove or pressured** — stay in lane
- The pull camp is **blocked** — deward first
- Enemy offlaner will **contest the pull** and kill you

## General Tips

- **Babysit vs. Roam Decision:**
  - Stay in lane if your carry can't survive alone (vs. aggressive dual offlane)
  - Roam if your carry is fine and other lanes need help (or if you can get a kill mid)
  - After your carry hits level 5-6 and has sustain, you can leave to make plays

- **Trading in lane:**
  - Stand between the enemy offlaner and your carry when possible
  - Use your regen to absorb harass so your carry can farm
  - Buy extra Tangos/Salves from sideshop or courier if needed

- **Save vs. Trade:**
  - Use abilities **defensively** to save teammates unless the kill is guaranteed
  - Glimmer, Force Staff, and Lotus Orb are more valuable than damage items
  - Dying to save your carry is WORTH IT in most cases after 20 min

- **Don't be afraid to die** for a good trade. A pos 5 death for an enemy core kill is always worth it.

- **Buy Smoke.** If nobody on your team is buying smoke, you buy it. Smoke wins games.

- **TP scroll always.** Never leave base without a TP. TP saves turn fights.

- **Communicate:** Ping enemy items, call Rosh timer, track ult cooldowns.

## Common Mistakes
- Soaking carry XP in lane when you're not doing anything useful (go pull or stack or roam)
- Not buying sentries — vision war is YOUR job
- Placing wards in the same spots every game (enemies learn your patterns)
- Saving spells for "the perfect moment" instead of using them (dead spells = wasted spells)
- Dying with TP off cooldown (you could have TPed to safety or a fight)
- Not stacking camps — free gold for your carry
- Walking through warded areas without smoke (giving away your position)
