# Draft Cheat-Sheet

Quick reference for drafting phase: synergies, bans, pick order, and team composition.

## Hero Synergies (Strong Combos)

### Wombo-Combo Pairs
| Combo | Why It Works |
|-------|-------------|
| Magnus + Ember Spirit | RP into Sleight of Fist + Chains on grouped enemies |
| Magnus + Sven | RP + God's Strength cleave = team wipe |
| Dark Seer + Sven/Ember | Vacuum + Wall into cleave / Sleight |
| Enigma + any AoE (Invoker, SK, Disruptor) | Black Hole groups enemies for massive follow-up |
| Faceless Void + Witch Doctor/Skywrath | Chrono + Death Ward / Mystic Flare on frozen targets |
| Tidehunter + any AoE follow-up | Ravage stun into team combo |
| Oracle + Huskar | False Promise + Huskar's low HP aggression = unkillable |
| Io + Tiny/CK/Ursa | Relocate ganks with burst damage carry |
| Grimstroke + Lion/Lina | Soulbind doubles single-target nukes |
| Shadow Demon + Mirana | Disruption setup into guaranteed Sacred Arrow |

### Lane Combos (Dual Lanes)
| Combo | Why It Works |
|-------|-------------|
| Juggernaut + Crystal Maiden | Spin + Frostbite = guaranteed early kills |
| Ursa + Shadow Shaman | Shackles + Overpower = dead offlaner |
| Phantom Assassin + Jakiro | Dagger slow + Liquid Fire = heavy harass |
| Slark + Grimstroke | Ink Swell + Pounce = stun + leash |
| Wraith King + Crystal Maiden | Wraithfire Blast + Frostbite = long lockdown |
| Drow Ranger + Vengeful Spirit | Aura stacking + Swap save + burst |

## Ban Priorities

### Heroes That Are Almost Always Worth Banning
These heroes are either very strong in the current meta or extremely annoying to play against:

| Tier | Heroes | Why Ban |
|------|--------|---------|
| Always consider | Spirit Breaker, Pudge | Constant ganking pressure disrupts all lanes |
| Strong laners | Viper, Huskar, Broodmother | Lane dominators that snowball if not countered |
| Scaling threats | Anti-Mage, Spectre, Medusa | If you can't end early, these heroes take over |
| Teamfight threats | Enigma, Magnus, Faceless Void | One good ult = lost fight |
| Meta-dependent | Check current patch | Ban whatever is currently overtuned |

### Context-Dependent Bans
- **If you're picking a melee carry:** Ban Viper, Ursa, or lane bullies
- **If you want to play late:** Ban Anti-Mage (outfarms you) or gankers (Spirit Breaker)
- **If you're drafting push:** Ban Keeper of the Light, Tinker, or wave-clear heroes
- **If you have key combo ults:** Ban Silencer (Global Silence cancels everything)

## Draft Order Tips

### What to Pick Early (1st-2nd phase)
- **Flexible heroes** that can play multiple roles: Marci, Pangolier, Vengeful Spirit, Dark Willow
- **Strong laners** that don't reveal your strategy: Ogre Magi, Jakiro, Treant Protector
- **Safe offlaners** that work in most games: Axe, Tidehunter, Centaur

### What to Pick Late (Last picks)
- **Mid matchup-dependent heroes:** Huskar, Broodmother, Meepo, Templar Assassin
- **Core heroes that get hard-countered:** Phantom Assassin (MKB), Medusa (mana burn), Morphling (AA)
- **Your carry** — last pick carry to avoid counters when possible

### General Draft Rules
1. **Don't reveal your strategy early.** Flexible picks first, position-locked picks last.
2. **Counter their first picks.** If they show a core early, pick into it.
3. **Don't pick all your cores first.** Supports early, cores late.
4. **Adapt.** If they counter your Plan A, have a Plan B hero pool.

## Team Composition Checklist

Before locking in your last pick, check that your team has:

| Need | Why | Examples |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Stun/Disable** (2-3 stuns minimum) | You need lockdown to kill targets | Sven stun, Lion Hex, Bane Grip |
| **Wave clear** | Push out lanes, defend high ground | Lina, Invoker, Shadow Fiend, Jakiro |
| **Frontline/Tank** | Someone to absorb damage in fights | Axe, Tidehunter, Bristleback, Centaur |
| **Save/Sustain** | Keep your cores alive in fights | Oracle, Dazzle, Omniknight, Glimmer carrier |
| **Tower damage** | You need to push objectives to win | Drow aura, Lone Druid Bear, Shadow Shaman wards |
| **Physical + Magic damage** | Mixed damage prevents enemy from itemizing one type | Don't go all-magic or all-physical |
| **Initiation** | Someone to start fights on your terms | Blink carriers: Axe, Magnus, Tidehunter, Earthshaker |
| **BKB-piercing disable** | Crucial for late game vs. BKB cores | Beastmaster Roar, Faceless Void Chrono, Axe Call |

### Red Flags in Your Draft
- No stuns → enemy can run at you freely
- No wave clear → you can't defend high ground
- All melee → you get kited and poked
- No BKB-piercing disable → enemy cores press BKB and win fight
- No save → your carry gets jumped and dies instantly
- All magic damage → enemy buys Pipe + BKB and ignores you

## Quick Pre-Game Checklist
1. Do we have enough stuns? (At least 2-3)
2. Can we push towers?
3. Do we have wave clear?
4. Is there a save for our carry?
5. Can we deal with BKB?
6. Do we have mixed damage types?

If the answer to 2+ of these is "no," reconsider your last pick.
