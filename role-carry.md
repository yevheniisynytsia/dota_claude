# Carry Guide (Pos 1)

Your job: farm efficiently, hit item timings, and win late-game fights.

## Networth Benchmarks

| Minute | Target Networth | What You Should Have |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| 10 | 5,000 - 6,500 | Phase/Treads + farming component (Midas/Perseverance/Maelstrom) |
| 15 | 8,000 - 10,000 | First core item completed or nearly done |
| 20 | 12,000 - 15,000 | First core + working on second |
| 25 | 16,000 - 20,000 | Two core items |
| 30 | 20,000 - 25,000 | Two-three core items + BKB |

> If you're below these numbers, focus harder on farming. If above, look for fights with your team.

## Key Item Timings

| Item | Target Minute | Heroes |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Battle Fury | 14-16 min | Anti-Mage, Phantom Assassin, Juggernaut |
| Radiance | 15-18 min | Spectre, Wraith King, Naga Siren, Alchemist |
| Manta Style | 20-22 min | Anti-Mage, Terrorblade, Luna |
| Maelstrom | 10-13 min | Faceless Void, Luna, Gyrocopter |
| Desolator | 14-17 min | Templar Assassin, Weaver, Clinkz |
| BKB | 20-25 min | Almost every carry (adjust per game) |
| Satanic | 30-35 min | Late-game survivability for most right-clickers |

## Farming Patterns

### Laning Phase (0-10 min)
1. Focus on **last hits** — aim for 50+ CS by 10 min
2. Use **creep aggro tricks**: right-click an enemy hero to draw creeps toward you
3. Pull the lane back if it pushes too far by aggro-ing enemy creeps toward your ranged creep
4. Only take jungle camps between creep waves — never miss a lane wave for a camp
5. Carry a **TP scroll** — use it to counter-dive or rotate to safe jungle if lane is too dangerous

### Mid-Game Farming (10-25 min)
1. Push out the **dangerous lane** (the one closest to enemy territory) with a wave, then retreat to jungle
2. Farm in a **triangle pattern**: lane wave → camp → camp → lane wave
3. Stack camps when walking past if your hero farms stacks well (cleave, AoE)
4. Always carry a **TP** to join big fights or defend towers
5. Take Roshan when your team has a numbers advantage and you have lifesteal/sustain

### Late-Game (25+ min)
1. Stay with your team for objectives
2. Only split push if you have a reliable escape (Blink, Time Lapse, Manta dodge)
3. Prioritize **Roshan** — Aegis is often the difference between winning and losing

## General Tips

- **Don't fight without your key items.** If your BKB isn't ready and the enemy has heavy lockdown, keep farming. Ping your item timer so your team knows.
- **Check enemy inventories.** If their carry is ahead, avoid man-fighting. If you're ahead, pressure objectives.
- **Lane equilibrium matters.** If the creep wave is under your tower, that's fine. If it's pushed past the river, pull or play safe.
- **Buy your own wards** if you need jungle vision and your support is busy. A 50g ward that saves your life is worth it.
- **TP usage is critical.** Save TP for counter-ganks or emergency defense. Don't waste it to walk to lane faster.
- **Communicate item timings.** Tell your team "BKB in 1 min" so they can prepare for a fight.
- **Rosh timers:** First Rosh at 20-25 min is ideal. Aegis lets you take high ground or fight fearlessly.

## Carry Ward Spots

### Safe Lane (Radiant)
- Ward on the **cliff above the pull camp** — covers river + jungle entry
- **Triangle ward** — covers both jungle camps and mid rotations
- **Lane ward** behind the enemy offlane T1 tower — see ganks coming from mid

### Safe Lane (Dire)
- Ward on the **high ground above the rune** — covers river + offlane rotations
- **Triangle ward** near the ancient camp — covers farming area
- **Shrine area ward** — see mid rotations early

## Common Mistakes
- Farming the jungle when lane creeps are available (lane creeps give more gold)
- Fighting without BKB against heavy disable lineups
- Ignoring Roshan when you have the advantage
- Not buying back when necessary in late game (always keep buyback gold after 30 min)
- Tunneling on one side of the map — move around to farm safely
